For my Sinatra portfolio project I made Malware.com. Unfortunately, and this may be one of the great tragedies of my life, the domain name 'Malware.com' is already taken; and the person who owns it isn't even doing anything with it. This could make a great site for just about anything, and it's being wasted by someone who won't even reveal their information to WHOIS. 
Long story short, my version on Malware.com allows users to create, edit, update, and destroy viruses (or virus links to be more specific). Each virus consists of a descriptive name and a link. 
Who exactly would go out of their way specifically looking for viruses? I have no idea, but I would imagine they would be quite devious. 
It was weird going back to Sinatra after using Rails & React. For a relatively modern web-design framework, it seems awfully primitive. I found it particularly odd that the routes are smashed directly into the controllers. Anyway, this was probably my last lab for Flatiron, so I must say, it's been real. Also, Learn IDE is really not very good, so consider maybe looking into that. It crashes/freezes all the time, randomly becomes incapable of saving  certain files, and has a tendency to disconnect and then wreck files when reconnecting.
