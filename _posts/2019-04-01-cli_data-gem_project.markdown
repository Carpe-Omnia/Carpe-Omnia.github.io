Forgive me if this description is a little bad. I wrote this gem several months ago, but I never got around to submitting it or writing a blog post.
Essentially, the gem allows users to gather information about superheroes from their command line. It uses a scraper (Nokogiri probably) to pull info from the corresponding pages on https://superheroes.fandom.com/wiki/Superhero_Wiki 
Because it uses a scraper rather than any form of API, the results can be rather inconsistent. I also failed to build in any significant error handling, so the whole application can come crashing down at a moment's notice. 
If anything, I'm glad I waited to long to write this blog-post. This gives me a great opportunity to see how much I've improved from only a few months ago. And what an improvement it has been. The diffrence between this app and anything I've written recently is like night and day. Thank you Flatiron Schools for helping me improve my code so much.
