In case it's not immediately clear to whoever is reading this, I was a student in Flatiron's Community Powered Bootcamp. 
Looking at the curriculum of the course, it seemed very clear to me that periodic portfolio projects would come with code reviews. After all, it said so in unambiguous terms right there in the labs. I realize that code reviews wouldn't be worth it (financially) to give to members of the CPB (seeing as our tuition is extremely low), but you could really make a note of it in the labs. That's really all I have to say on the matter. If you're reading this, I'm sorry my blog post is so inelegantly written. Have a pleasant day/evening.
