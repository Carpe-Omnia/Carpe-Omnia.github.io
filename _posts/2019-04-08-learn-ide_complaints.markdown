Learn IDE is really not very good, so consider maybe looking into it. My complaints are several.
* It crashes/freezes all the time. I've lost quite a bit of work to this over the last couple months.  
* Randomly becomes incapable of saving  certain files. This one is a real eyebrow raiser. It will be able to save some files but not others. Why? 
* Has a tendency to disconnect and then wreck files when reconnecting. This one is also pretty annoying. It makes me feel like I'm on a shot-clock every time I'm working on a lab, because if I go too long without touching the IDE it'll disconnect from the server (which is basically as bad as a crash if you ask me). 
* Messes with files that have been sent to GitHub. Another eyebrow raiser. It randomly inserts long strings of alphanumeric characters into seeming random parts of the file. This doesn't happen every time, but it happens often enough that it's super annoying. 
* Hosting issues? When the IDE sets up a server that runs on localhost, I'm not able to connect to it through my browser. I kinda understand why this is happening (the IDE is a virtual machine running inside my actual machine) but I feel like there must be some way to circumvent this.
* Randomly re-forking labs while I'm working on something. This is also super annoying. The IDE will do basically the same process as when you hit the 'open-ide' button, but it'll just go rogue and do it on its own .There's at least one lab I literally can't complete because every time I open the IDE it gets stuck in an infinite loop of cloning and forking. 
That's pretty much it. Aside from these complaints (and any more I can't think of right now) the IDE is pretty solid. Good choice basing it on Atom, Atom is my favorite text editor. (I used to like notepad++ until I realized how much better just about anything else was).
