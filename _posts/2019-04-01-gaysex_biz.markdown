This app has a tiny bit of a story that's essential for context. So I was straight chilling with a (gay) friend of mine a month or two ago, just shooting the shit and laughing about dumb stuff. Eventually we got on to the topic of domain names (check out https://www.domainking.com/  if you haven't already seen it) and started looking up which ones were funny and also cheap. Eventually she stumbled upon the, suprisingly cheap, availability of GaySex.biz and instantly knew she had to have it. 
As the one in the room with web dev skills, I obviously agreed to help turn the site into more than just a parking page. We moved hosting from GoDaddy (which was incredibly restrictive) to Heroku (which was free for our needs) and the rest is history. I still use the site to test out all sorts of stuff, and it has some pretty solid functionality. 
Although I didn't undertake this project with Flatiron School specifically in mind, I think it more than adequately fits the requirements.
